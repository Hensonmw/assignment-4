# Assignment 4

This assignment is going to be rather easy (particularly compared to the last assignment) and pretty short.  It is largely based on the information that we covered during lecture that is also in Chapters 1 and 2 of the book.

As before, fork and clone this repository.  Then create a directory equal to your username within the `answers` directory.  Name each of the programs you are writing, according to the "task" (e.g. task1.py) and add those to your username folder within the `answers` directory.  Commit those programs, push them up to your cloned repository, and make a pull request.

## Task 1

Write a complete program, formatted in the way that we discussed, that prints the range of numbers, 0 to 50, by 5.  Have the program output each of these numbers, separated by commas, on the same line.  Do not do this in a function.  Name this program

## Task 2

Based on what you wrote, above, create another program with a main function that calls a separate function (name of your choice) to print out the same information requested in [Task 1](task-1).

## Task 3

Modify the program you created in Task 2 to print the numbers out in reverse order (highest to lowest).

## Task 4

String operations are great and lots of fun. You'll be dealing with strings a lot (more fun awaits when we specifically talk about strings).  Write a program with a main function that calls a separate function (name of your choice) to print your 5 favorite words, separated by newlines.

## Task 5

In [Task 4](task-4), you basically concatenated strings.  There are several ways to do this.  Alter the program that you wrote above to print your 5 favorite words, separated by newlines, but do this in a different way from how you did it in [Task 4](task-4).

## Task 6

We talked a little bit about types.  Write a program with a main function that calls **two** separate functions to show the type of (1) a numpy array, and (2) a sequence object (from biopython).
